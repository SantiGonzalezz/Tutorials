# Tutorials

This repository has tutorial of different tools that I have been learning in my Programming journey. It specially contains Data Science relationated aspects.

The tutorial available are:

- [Markdown](https://github.com/SantiGonzalezz/Tutorials/blob/main/Markdown.md)
- [Numpy](https://github.com/SantiGonzalezz/Tutorials/blob/main/Numpy.ipynb)
- [Pandas]()
- [Matplotlib]()
- [SQL in Python]()

Mostly of the tutorials have coding, principally in Python, in consequence the Jupyter Notebooks are the preferred tool.

Even though GitHub has a visualizer for this type of file, it does not allows to make the links inside the files to work.

Due this, the recommendation is to upload the Notebook on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/).
